## Introduction

The Web Code Editor is designed to provide a convenient platform for developers to write and test HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code snippets without the need for an external code editor or IDE. It offers a simple and intuitive interface for entering code and viewing the output instantly.

## Features

- **Real-time Output**: The editor updates the output dynamically as users type in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code.
- **Copy Functionality**: Users can easily copy the code from each section (HTML, CSS, JS) using the provided "Copy" buttons.
- **Save Option**: Users can save their code locally using the "Save" button, allowing them to revisit and edit their code later.
- **Lock/Unlock Input Fields**: The "Lock/Unlock" button enables users to prevent accidental changes to the code by locking the input fields.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter HTML code in the "HTML" textarea, CSS code in the "CSS" textarea, and JavaScript code in the "JS" textarea.
3. The output will be displayed in the designated area below the input fields.
4. Use the "Copy" buttons to copy the code from each textarea.
5. Click the "Save" button to save your code locally for future reference.
